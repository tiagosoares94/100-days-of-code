# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started to code part of [Bikcraft Project](https://github.com/tiagosoares94/bikcraft/commits/master). But this is an online course, i'll follow the rules and make another projects, a real one.
I decided to continue my progress at FreeCodeCamp, i'm finishing the jQuery part and i'll start to make the Tribute Page soon.

**Thoughts:** This is my first day, I'm excited and happy for this challenge.

### Day 2: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished Tribute Page, the first front end project of FreeCodeCamp. I've spent more than one hour, but that was very well spent time. I aquired a lot of knowledge and I enjoyed to learn more about HTML and CSS.  

**Thoughts:** I didn't make any code optiomization for CSS classes. I need to pratice more.

### Day 3: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Usually I spent more than one hour doing the challenge, but today was a busy day. So, I finished my jQuery exercises at FreeCodeCamp and started to think about the layout of my next project, Personal Portfolio Webpage.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed jQuery, it is easy to use. Of course, i did some examples only, let's see if this will be easy later in a real project.
